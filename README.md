## Getting Started
We recommend using the provided Docker Compose configuration for local development. Our Docker configuration includes:
1. Automatically create both database and app server easily
2. Hot-reloading of code for local development
3. Production-ready minified image
4. Database admin interface using [Cloudbeaver](https://hub.docker.com/r/dbeaver/cloudbeaver)

However, you can still use this repo without Docker! See the instructions below.

### Using Docker
1. `docker compose up` (initial build can take a couple of mins)
2. That's it! Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your app running

### Without Docker
If you don't want to use Docker, make sure you have a Postgres database that you can connect to. 
1. `npm install`
2. Copy the provided `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
2. `npm run start:dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your app running

## Deploying to FL0
Checkout our [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.fl0.com) in the FL0 documentation!

## Using the Database Admin Interface
If you use our Docker Compose file you have access to a local instance of Cloudbeaver. To access it:

1. Start the project using `docker compose --profile db-admin up`
    - P.S. You may need to run `docker compose down` first if you have already started the project
    
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8081
3. Follow the setup wizard to create your admin account
4. Add a new connection using the PostgreSQL driver and the URL below

`jdbc:postgresql://db:5432/fl0-starter-db?user=admin&password=admin`
